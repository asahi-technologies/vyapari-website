                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures
                            designed to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
                            destruction.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">However, transacting and communicating over the internet involves
                            inherent risks, and complete security cannot be guaranteed. You are encouraged to follow
                            good security practices, such as using strong passwords, restricting access to your devices,
                            and avoiding sharing your login credentials.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Where we transfer your information to servers or service providers
                            located in other jurisdictions, we take steps to ensure that an adequate level of protection
                            is in place in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">By using the Vyapari App, you understand that your information may be
                            processed and stored in locations that may have different data protection rules than your
                            country.</p>
